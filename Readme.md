# A conneted self-driving Car in a Smart City with Confluent Kafka
In a smart city the self-driving-car will be sooner then later a common situation. That's why it is important to build a working foundation to enable all the benefits.
The story of this demo is quite simple:
* We simulate a self-driving-car with UDACITY App. This App uses a self-trained model to steer the car. If you want you create your own model `model.5h`. Please follow these [instructions](createModel/Readme.md)
* The App is sending data to the backbone (implemented with Confluent Platform or Apache Kafka). We send location and sensordata. Sensor Data is coming directly from Self-Driving Car App.
* Additionally we have other stakeholders using the backbone to add specific information like advertisements or Alerts e.g. info of an accident. 
* We correlate the information and do bi-directional communication with all stake-holder.
* It shows how easy it is to share information on different channels to give a experience and enable lots of benefits for all stakeholders. 

The next graphic shows the high level architecture of this demo:

Before executing the demo you need to install a couple of things.

## Prereqs - Installation
Before going into detail you have to prepare your environment as followed (I use macos Catalina):
* Have Python 3 running
* install important python modules
* Have confluent cli installed, see [docu](https://docs.confluent.io/confluent-cli/current/installing.html)
* Have Confluent Platform 6.1 running on your machine [Installation Guide](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/installation/installing_cp/zip-tar.html#prod-kafka-cli-install)
* Download and unzip UDACITY Simulator. [Download from here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim) and rename the app `SelfDrivingCar-Simulator`.
* have iTerm 2 installed
* have a working notification App on your IoS device. I use Pushover but you can also use Telegram or similar apps

## Install Python Modules
```bash
# Python version should 3.8
python3 --version
# install important moduls to allow execution without error
pip3 install flask
pip3 install python-socketio==2.1.2
pip3 install eventlet
pip3 install opencv-python
pip3 install tensorflow
pip3 install keras
pip3 install Pillow
pip3 install python-engineio==2.2.0
pip3 install pykafka
pip3 install confluent_kafka
# Set Path for Python 3.8
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python@3.8/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```
## Clone this repo
Clone my repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ora0600/connected-selfdrivingcar-in-a-smartcity-with-Confluent-Kafka.git
```
Now, everything is stored for execute this demo.
You need to download Simlulator by yourself following these instructions:
Download Simulator Version 1 from : [UDACITY](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim)
```bash
mkdir self-driving-car
cd self-driving-car
wget https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/November/5831f290_simulator-macos/simulator-macos.zip
unzip simulator-macos.zip 
rm  simulator-macos.zip 
# if you want rename the simulator App. Please rename.
# I did use SelfDrivingCar-Simulator, do renaming in MacOS Finder
```
We are simulating a kind of car-cockpit with a navigator app. For this we need token, that's why we have to register at mapbox.com

## Register and get token from mapbox
To use the maps in our demo we need to get access. For this we have to register in mapbox.
You can follow this [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vD9Ic8KqEDw)
Please register under [mapbox.com](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signin/?route-to=%22https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/%22)
Enter your data, verify your email address and then login into mapbox.com and you will get your public token.
Add your token into `static/leaf.js`: `accessToken: 'ABCD' //ENTER YOUR TOKEN HERE`

## Register to Pushover
If you do not want to use Pushover, then use Telegram. In my github repositories I do have some samples around [Telegram](https://github.com/ora0600/apache-kafka-as-a-service-by-confluent/tree/master/webinar1).
Signup to [Pushover](https://pushover.net/login) you will get free access for a week or so.
* Install PushOver App on you iPhone
* Login into [Pushover](https://pushover.net/login)
* Add your Device
* Create a new Application (enter the name e.g. selfdrivingcar is enough) and copy the token and your user key
* Change token in Python script
Change Python script `push2ios.py`:
```bash
# change 
urllib.parse.urlencode({
            "token": "ABCD",
            "user": "EFGH",
```

## Run Demo

Run the script `00_start_selfdrivingcar_demo.sh` everything will be open automatically.
Want will be opened:
*  SelfDrivingCar-Simulator App: `open -a SelfDrivingCar-Simulator`: Please use 6400*480 resolution and click the button autonomous mode
* python3 drive.py will executed. This Micrsoservice is the edge service within the self-driving-car
* python3 geo_consumer.py will get the information of the self-driving-car (location) and maybe additional infos like Alerts and adverstisements
* python3 push2ios.py will send notification to iPhone 
* chrome window with http://localhost:5001/topic/selfdrivingcar will show the consumer results in webbrower
* chrome window with http://localhost:5001/ is showing the with current location

Now, you can see you car driving alone and you got the location of car driving around the NÃ¼rburgring.
Push important notifcations to the app. e.g.
* Special advertisements from the Hotels
* Or Alert e.g. an accident is close to your location.

Do that please ksql (TODO):
```bash
ksql
ksql> INSERT INTO
```

These information will be pushed to your iPhone and to your cockpit of your car.

### enhancements of the setup
Some enhancements. I did place everything on my desk to that every piece of this demo is visible. If this setup is not possible in your own environment, then you have to change `template/index.html`
![My setup](images/my_setup.png)


### additional possibilities

1. you can add your own route close to your neighbourhood if you want. For this add the simluated route into geo.json
    * add your own map view: change `static/leaf.js`and place the viewport `var mymap = L.map('mapid').setView([50.336, 6.94], 15);` with right location point in latitude, longitude
2. Of course you can do a multiplayer mode. For this every player runs its own App including Microservice. The only thing you have to gurantee that each player is using the same Confluent Kafka cluster.

## Stop Demo environment

Exit all terminals with CTRL+c.
Shutdown COnfluent Platform and destroy content:
```bash
confluent local services stop
confluent local destroy
```
